            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>I'm Krish. I'm a fourteen year old in 9th grade who likes to code. I'll add more to this when I have more stuff to add, but for now I can't really think of much to say so I'm just saying random stuff to take up space because I want to see how the layout will look.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>I code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I use databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. I use frameworks like ReactJS, NodeJS, AngularJS, and VueJS. I don't do as much Web Development so I don't have as much to say, but once again, I am inputting random text because I would like to visualize the layout of my text. Penguins are pretty cool right. Yes they are. Okay I think this is enough. Thank you for cooperation and have a good day, month, year, decade, and century.</p>

                <h3>Mobile Development</h3>
                <p>I primarily use Swift and Xcode to program iOS apps. I also use Java with Android Studio for Android apps, and React Native, a JavaScript framework, to build  native mobile apps for both iOS and Android. I use databases like Realm, CoreData, and Firebase. Using Swift's frameworks such as UIKit, CoreML, SceneKit, ARKit, SpriteKit and Vision, I've created a wide variety of apps ranging  from image detection with machine learning and Apple's CoreML models, to augmented reality apps using Apple's ARSCNView. </p>
